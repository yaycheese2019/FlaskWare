# FlaskWare

this is still in development, so some of the features might be buggy

# How to install

when the "flaskWare" folder is downloaded make sure to put it in Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Garry's Mod/garrysmod/lua
<br><br>
when you're ingame type in the console "lua_openscript_cl flaskWare/mainCore.lua" and that will load the script
<br><br>
also make sure to bind a key (like insert) to "flask_open_gui" so you can access the menu
